# bulls-and-cows-game
I wrote a REST server to facilitate playing a number guessing game known as "Bulls and Cows". In each game, a 4-digit number is generated where every digit is different. For each round, the user guesses a number and is told the exact and partial digit matches.  An exact match occurs when the user guesses the correct digit in the correct position. A partial match occurs when the user guesses the correct digit but in the wrong position. Once the number is guessed (exact matches for all digits) the user wins the game. Recoommended to use Postman to verify your endpoints behave the way you expect them to be.
